Podkarpackie Voivodeship or Podkarpackie Province (in Polish: wojew dztwo podkarpackie [v j vut stf  p tkar patsk ]), also known as Subcarpathian Voivodeship, is a voivodeship, or province, in extreme-southeastern Poland. Its administrative capital and largest city is Rzesz w. (Historically Lw w was the administrative center of this part of Poland, but after 1945, when Lw w became part of the Soviet Union, that city's role was relinquished to Rzesz w.)
The voivodeship was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Rzesz w, Przemy l, Krosno and (partially) Tarn w and Tarnobrzeg Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local-government reforms adopted in 1998. The name derives from the region's location near the Carpathian Mountains, and the voivodeship comprises areas of two historic regions of Eastern Europe   Lesser Poland (western and northwestern counties) and Red Ruthenia. In the Interbellum, Subcarpathian Voivodeship belonged to "Poland B", the less-developed, more rural parts of Poland. To boost the local economy, the government of the Second Polish Republic began in the mid-1930s a massive program of industrialization, known as the Central Industrial Region. The program created several major armament factories, including PZL Mielec, PZL Rzesz w, Huta Stalowa Wola, and factories in other Subcarpathian towns such as D bica, Nowa D ba, Sanok, Tarnobrzeg and Nowa Sarzyna.
It is bordered by Lesser Poland Voivodeship to the west,  wi tokrzyskie Voivodeship to the north-west, Lublin Voivodeship to the north, Ukraine to the east and Slovakia to the south. It covers an area of 17,844 square kilometres (6,890 sq mi), and has a population of 2,096,971 (as at 2006). The voivodeship is mostly hilly or mountainous (see Bieszczady, Beskidy); its northwestern corner is flat. It is one of the most wooded Polish voivodeships (35.9% of total area), within its borders there is whole Bieszczady National Park, and parts of Magura National Park. Furthermore, the creation of Turnicki National Park is planned.



The voivodeship contains 50 cities and towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures as of 30 June 2008)



Subcarpathian Voivodeship is divided into 25 counties (powiats): 4 city counties and 21 land counties. These are further divided into 160 gminas.
The counties are listed in the following table (ordering within categories is by decreasing population).
