The z oty (pronounced [ zw t ]; sign: z ; code: PLN), which literally means "golden", is the currency of Poland. The modern z oty is subdivided into 100 groszy (singular: grosz, alternative plural forms: grosze; groszy). The recognized English form of the word is zloty, plural zloty or zlotys. The currency sign, z , is composed of Polish small letters z and   (Unicode: U+007A z latin small letter z & U+0142   latin small letter l with stroke).
As a result of inflation in the early 1990s, the currency underwent redenomination. Thus, on January 1, 1995, 10,000 old z otych (PLZ) became one new z oty (PLN). Since then, the currency has been relatively stable, with an exchange rate fluctuating between 2.5-4 zloty for a United States dollar.









The z oty (golden) is a traditional Polish currency unit dating back to the Middle Ages. Initially, in the 14th and 15th centuries, the name was used for all kinds of foreign gold coins used in Poland, most notably Venetian and Hungarian ducats. In 1496 the Sejm approved the creation of a national currency, the z oty, and its value was set at 30 groszy, a coin minted since 1347 and modelled on the Prague groschen. The grosz was subdivided into 2 p grosz or 3 solidi.
The name z oty (sometimes referred to as the florin) was used for a number of different coins, including the 30 groszy coin called the polski z oty, the czerwony z oty (Red z oty) and the z oty re ski (the Rhine guilder), which were in circulation at the time. However, the value of the Polish z oty dropped over time relative to these foreign coins and it became a silver coin, with the foreign ducats eventually circulating at approximately 5 z otych.
Following the monetary reform carried out by King Stanis aw August Poniatowski, the z oty became Poland's official currency and the exchange rate of 1 z oty to 30 groszy was confirmed. Until 1787, the z oty was tied to the Conventionsthaler of the Holy Roman Empire, with 8 z oty equal to one Conventionsthaler and, consequently, 4 groschen equal to the z oty. Two debasements of the currency occurred in the years before the final partition of Poland.



The z oty remained in circulation after the Partitions of Poland and the Duchy of Warsaw issued coins denominated in grosz, z oty and talar (plurals talary and talar w), worth 6 z oty. Talar banknotes were also issued.



From 1816, the z oty was issued by the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, with a fixed exchange rate between the Polish and Russian currencies of 1 kopeck = 2 grosze, or 15 kopeck = 1 z oty. The Warsaw mint issued grosz and z oty until 1832, when it began to issue coins denominated in both Polish and Russian currencies. From 1842, the Warsaw mint issued regular type Russian coins along with some coins denominated in both grosz and kopeck. In 1850, the last coins bearing Polish denominations were minted. Between 1835 and 1846, the Free City of Krak w also issued a currency, the Krak w z oty




From 1850, the only currency issued for use in Congress Poland was the rubel consisting of Russian currency and notes of the Bank Polski. The monetary system of Congress Poland was unified with the Russian Empire following the failed January Uprising in 1863. However, the gold coins remained in use until the early 20th century, much like other gold coins of the epoch, most notably gold roubles (dubbed  winka, or piggy) and sovereigns. Following occupation of the Congress Poland by Germans during World War I in 1917, the rubel was replaced by the marka (plurals marki and marek), a currency initially equivalent to the German Papiermark.






The z oty was reintroduced as Poland's currency by W adys aw Grabski in 1924, following the hyperinflation and monetary chaos of the years after World War I. It replaced the marka at a rate of 1 z oty = 1,800,000 marek and was subdivided into 100 groszy. The z oty was pegged at 0.1687 grams pure gold. 1 1939-z oty = 8 2004-z oty.




On December 15, 1939, the new Bank Emisyjny was established by the General Government, itself set up by Nazi Germany. In May 1940, old banknotes of 1924 1939 were stamped by the new entity. The money exchange was limited per individual, the limits varied according to the status of the person (Pole, Jew, etc.). The fixed exchange rate 1 Reichsmark = 2 z ote was established. A new issue of notes appeared in 1941. The General Government also issued coins using similar designs to earlier types but with cheaper metals.



New z oty banknotes were introduced after July 22, 1944 by the Narodowy Bank Polski. They circulated until 1950.




In 1950, a new z oty (PLZ) was introduced, replacing all earlier issues at a rate of one hundred to one. The new banknotes were dated 1948, while the new coins were dated 1949. Initially by law from 1950 1 z oty (z ) = 0.222168 g of pure gold, see also Dziennik Ustaw 50, 459. From January 1, 1990 it was a convertible currency.
Between 1950 and 1990, a unit known as the z oty dewizowy (which can be roughly translated as the foreign exchange z oty) was used as an artificial currency for calculation purposes only. It existed because at the time the z oty was not convertible and its official rate of exchange was set by the Government, and there existed several exchange rates depending on the purpose of the transaction and who was exchanging, i.e. a given amount in z oty could be exchanged for say US dollars at one of several official exchange rates depending on what was to be bought for the hard currency and the company that was buying foreign exchange; it worked similarly when a company had some earnings in Western currency and wanted (or needed) to convert them into z otych. The exchange rate did not depend on the amount being converted. Visitors from countries outside of the Soviet Bloc were offered a particularly poor exchange rate. Concurrently, the private black-market exchange rate contrasted sharply with the official government exchange rate until the end of Communist rule in 1989 when official rates were tied to market rates.




The new Polish z oty (PLN) is the unofficial name of the current currency of Poland, introduced on January 1, 1995 as a result of the redenomination of the old currency. The official name of the Polish currency did not change since the Polish currency law of 1950 (DZ.U nr 50. poz. 459 with later changes), which defines the official currency as the z oty, up to one million denominated notes remains in effect. The redenomination rate was 10,000 old Polish z oty to 1 new Polish z oty. The issuing bank is the National Bank of Poland. See also original law from 7 July 1994 Dziennik Ustaw Nr 84, 386




Conditions of Poland's joining the European Union (in May 2004) oblige the country to eventually adopt the euro, though not at any specific date and only after Poland meets the necessary stability criteria. Serious discussions of joining the Eurozone have ensued. However, article 227 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland will need to be amended first, so it seems unlikely that Poland will adopt the euro before 2019. Public opinion research by CBOS from March 2011 shows that 60% of Poles are against changing their currency. Only 32% of Poles want to adopt the euro, compared to 41% in April 2010.






In the late 18th century, coins were issued in denominations of 1 3, 1 2, 1, 3, 6, 7 1 2, 10 and 15 groszy, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 z otych. The 1 3 and 1 2 grosz were denominated as the solidus and polgrosz, whilst the 7 1 2 and 15 groszy (copper) were denominated as 1 and 2 silver groschen. Coins up to 3 grosz were minted in copper, those between 6 and 15 grosz were billon whilst the denominations from 1 z oty upward were in silver.
The Duchy of Warsaw issued copper 1 and 3 grosze, billon 5 and 10 groszy and silver 1 6, 1 3 and 1 talar. After 1816, the Congress Poland issued copper 1 and 3 grosze, billon 5 and 10 groszy, silver 1, 2, 5 and 10 z otych, and gold 25 and 50 z otych. During the insurrection of 1831, coins were minted for 3 and 10 groszy, 2 and 5 z otych.
Between 1832 and 1834, coins denominated in both Polish and Russian currencies were issued, for 1 z oty (15 kopeck), 2 z ote (30 kopeck), 5 z otych (3 4 ruble), 10 z otych (1 1 2 ruble) and 20 z otych (3 ruble). These were issued, along with the copper and billon coins, until 1841. In 1842, Russian coins were introduced, supplemented by 40 groszy (20 kopeck) and 50 groszy (25 kopeck) coins. These two coins were issued until 1850.



In 1924, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 groszy, 1 and 2 z ote. The lowest three denominations were first minted in brass, then in bronze. The 10, 20 and 50 groszy were in nickel, with the higher denominations in silver. Gold 10 and 20 z otych coins were minted in 1925. Silver 5 z otych coins were introduced in 1928. The size of the silver coins was reduced in 1932, a move accompanied by the introduction of silver 10 z otych coins. During the German occupation of World War II, 1, 5, 10 and 20 groszy coins were issued (dated 1923) in zinc and 50 groszy (dated 1938) in nickel plated iron or iron.



In 1950, coins were issued for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 groszy and 1 z oty. All denominations were minted in aluminium. Previously (1949) the 5 groszy was minted in bronze, the denominations above 5 groszy minted in cupro-nickel and 1 and 2 groszy were in aluminium. From 1957, aluminium coins for 5, 10, 20 and 50 groszy and 1 z oty were issued, with aluminium 2 and 5 z otych introduced in 1958. Cupro-nickel 10 and 20 z otych followed in 1959 and 1973, respectively. Brass 2 and 5 z otych were introduced in 1975, reverting to aluminium in 1989. In 1990, 1 (aluminium), 10, 20, 50 and 100 z otych coins were issued, although they saw little circulation due to the high inflation occurring at that time.



Coins were introduced in 1995 (dated from 1990) in denominations of 1, 2, 5 (colloquially called miedziaki corresponding to its copper colour or dziady as coins with very low value and identified with poor people), 10, 20 and 50 groszy, 1 (colloquially called z ot wka), 2 (colloquially called dw jka) and 5 z otych (colloquially called pi tka). The 1, 2, and 5 groszy are minted in brass, and the 10, 20 and 50 groszy and 1 z oty in cupro-nickel, whilst the 2 and 5 z otych are bimetallic. 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 z otych coins also exist and are legal tender, but are not in normal circulation. The 5, 10, 20 z otych coins are often made of silver whilst the 25, 50, 100, 200, 500 z otych coins are made of gold. They are minted by the Mint of Poland and issued by the Bank of Poland for the main purpose of numismatics. Until 2014, commemorative 2 zl coins were issued every year, an average of 20 annually, made of Nordic Gold; they are legal tender, but not recommended for circulation. In 2014, the Polish Mint introduced new versions of the 1, 2, and 5 groszy minted in brass-plated steel.

In 1794, treasury notes were issued in denominations of 5 and 10 groszy, 1 z oty, 4 z ote, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 z otych. The Duchy of Warsaw issued notes for 1, 2 and 5 talar w.
In 1836, the Bank Kassowy Kr lestwa Polskiego issued notes for 10, 50 and 100 z otych. The Bank Polski issued notes dated 1830 and 1831 in denominations of 1, 5, 50 and 100 z otych, whilst assignats for 200 and 500 z otych were issued during the insurrection of 1831. From 1841, the Bank Polski issued notes denominated in rubel.



In 1924, along with provisional notes (overprints on old, bisected notes) for 1 and 5 groszy, the Ministry of Finance issued notes for 10, 20 and 50 groszy, whilst the Bank Polski introduced 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 z otych. From 1925, the Ministry of Finance issued 2 and 5 z otych notes, before they were replaced by silver coins, and the Bank Polski issued 5, 10, 20 and 50 z otych notes, with 100 z otych only reintroduced in 1932. In 1936, the Bank Polski issued 2 z ote notes, followed in 1938 by Ministry of Finance notes for 1 z oty.
In 1939, the General Government overprinted 100 z otych notes for use before, in 1940, the Bank Emisyjny w Polsce was set up and issued notes for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 z otych. After liberation, notes (dated 1944) were introduced by the Narodowy Bank Polski for 50 grosz, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 z otych, with 1000 z otych notes added in 1945.



In 1950, new notes (dated 1948), were introduced for 2 z ote, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 z otych. 1000 z otych notes were added in 1962. 200 and 2000 z otych notes were added in 1976 and 1977, followed by 5000 z otych notes in 1982. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw high inflation in Poland and led to the introduction of notes in denominations of 10,000 (in 1987), 20,000 (1989), 50,000 (1989), 100,000 (1990), 200,000 (1989), 500,000 (1990), 1,000,000 (1991) and 2,000,000 z otych (1992). A possible 5,000,000 zlotych banknotes with the portrait of Marshall Jozef Pilsudski was in planning, but scrapped after the fall of Communism. These notes (and coins of course) were valid (with the exception of the 200,000 one) until the end of 1996. They could be exchanged at the National Bank of Poland (and some banks obligated to it by the NBP) until December 31, 2010; they are no longer legal tender.



In 1995, notes were introduced in denominations of 10 (colloquially called dycha), 20, 50, 100 (colloquially called st wa or st wka) and 200 z otych. Since 2006 several commemorative banknotes for collectors have been issued.
On September 24, 2013, the National Bank of Poland presented new banknotes in denominations of 10, 20, 50 and 100 z otych. The designs of the originals have remained unchanged, but the security features have been improved, such as, among others, an outdoor field watermark, enhanced security on both front and back, and the introduction of an opaque paint. The new banknotes were put into circulation on April 7, 2014. On June 23, 2015, a new banknote of 200 z otych was presented, which is planned for introduction in February 2016 and also announced plans of introduction of a new denomination of 500 z otych with Jan III Sobieski in 2017. All old banknotes from the 1994 series are valid indefinitely.
